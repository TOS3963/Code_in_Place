# Code_in_Place

All of the code in this repository was created for my projects and learnings during Code in Place. My final project was anything I wished to code so I recreated Tetris using Python and TKinter. While I didn't use Github during the course (so my changes to the code are not present), I did upload all my versions which changed as I altered my approach to the problem and learned the TKinter library. 

Some of the code is written for Karel, a python learning tool used at Stanford.
